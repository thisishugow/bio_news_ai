    # Continuous Manufacturing in Biopharmaceuticals ðŸ§«
    ## TL;DR

    * Continuous manufacturingðŸ§¬ significantly reduces the cost of goods for 
    biopharmaceuticals.
    * Companies can achieve higher productivity with a smaller plant 
    footprint using continuous manufacturing.
    * Continuous manufacturing facilities are easier to scale out 
    for increased production.

    Continuous manufacturing is a ðŸ”¥ hot topic in the biopharmaceutical industry 
    because it can significantly reduce the cost of goods. This is because 
    continuous manufacturing facilities have a smaller footprint and can achieve higher 
    productivity than conventional manufacturing facilitiesðŸ“ˆ. When building a new continuous 
    manufacturing facility, it is important to connect the unit operations so that the process 
    flows continuously. This can be challenging at first, but once the platform is set up, it is 
    easy to scale out the production by adding more units.
